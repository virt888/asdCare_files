Understanding:
  - question: "What exactly is ASD? What is its full name?"
    answer: "ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects social interaction, communication, and behavioral development."
  
  - question: "Is there a cure for ASD?"
    answer: "There is no 'cure' for ASD, but early intervention, training, and support can significantly improve social, communication, and life skills, helping individuals better adapt to society."
  
  - question: "I don’t believe a child has ASD; who is qualified to determine whether a child has it?"
    answer: "ASD is typically diagnosed by pediatric specialists, child psychiatrists, or clinical psychologists using standard assessment tools (such as ADOS and ADI-R). If you doubt the diagnosis, consider seeking a second opinion from another professional to ensure accuracy."
  
  - question: "My grandmother says the child is fine, just possessed by a ghost, and even seeks help from gods—what should we do?"
    answer: "Explain that ASD is a developmental brain issue, not a case of possession. The diagnosis is confirmed by doctors. While spiritual practices might provide comfort, the child still needs professional intervention to make progress. Respect her beliefs, but ensure the child receives proper treatment to avoid conflicts."

Acceptance:
  - question: "Why do I feel my child is no different from other children?"
    answer: "Every child with ASD has unique traits. Some may have strong language abilities, while others struggle socially. The diagnosis is based on behavioral assessments rather than mere appearance, so subtle differences might not be immediately apparent."
  
  - question: "Will ASD affect my child's future job prospects, dating, or marriage?"
    answer: "ASD can impact social and communication skills, but every individual's development is unique. With appropriate support, children can pursue education, work, and even build their own families. The key is to help them discover their strengths and find an environment where they can thrive."
  
  - question: "How can I help my family accept the reality of ASD?"
    answer: "Acceptance takes time. Many parents initially resist the diagnosis. Providing professional information, joining support groups, and connecting with other ASD families can gradually help your family understand that ASD doesn’t mean hopelessness—proper support can lead to positive growth."
  
Action:
  - question: "My child has ASD—what can I, as a parent, do to help?"
    answer: "Start by learning about ASD and how to communicate effectively with your child, using methods like visual aids or simple instructions. Additionally, consider enrolling your child in professional therapies—such as speech therapy, occupational therapy, or social skills groups—to help them adapt to daily life."
  
  - question: "The school doesn’t understand ASD and treats my child as a problem student—what should I do?"
    answer: "Proactively communicate with the school by providing ASD-related information to help teachers understand your child's learning style. Arrange meetings with teachers or school social workers, share evaluation reports, and discuss tailored learning methods like one-on-one instruction or social support."
  
  - question: "What community resources are available to support ASD families?"
    answer: "There are many resources available, including government-funded early intervention programs, special childcare centers, and various NGO-led parent support groups and workshops. Joining ASD parent communities can also help in sharing information and tackling challenges together."
  
  - question: "Can I help my child make friends with other children with ASD?"
    answer: "Absolutely! Many children with ASD benefit from interacting with peers who share similar experiences—whether through interest classes or social groups. This not only enhances their social skills but also reduces feelings of isolation by showing them they aren’t alone."
  
  - question: "As a parent caring for a child with ASD long-term, I feel utterly exhausted. What should I do?"
    answer: "Caring for a child with ASD can be extremely demanding. It's crucial to take time for yourself—consider sharing caregiving responsibilities with family members or joining parent support groups to share experiences. If you're feeling overwhelmed, seeking help from social workers or mental health professionals can be very beneficial."

Social and Daily Life:
  - question: "Why does my child with ASD often play alone and avoid interacting with others?"
    answer: "Children with ASD might lack interest in social interactions or may not know how to start a conversation. Parents can help by using role-playing, flashcards, or similar methods to teach communication skills, and by arranging group activities to foster interaction."
  
  - question: "Why does my child with ASD sometimes suddenly throw tantrums, cry, or lose control?"
    answer: "Children with ASD may experience anxiety due to environmental changes, sensory overload (like loud noises or bright lights), or difficulties expressing themselves, which can trigger tantrums. Observing pre-tantrum signs can help parents adjust the environment in advance or use simple language and visuals to help the child express their needs."
  
  - question: "Why do children with ASD show such varied learning abilities—excelling in some areas while struggling in others?"
    answer: "ASD affects learning patterns differently; a child might excel in areas like math, spatial skills, or music but have challenges with language comprehension and social interaction. Tailoring educational methods to their strengths, such as using visual aids or concise instructions, can help them learn more effectively."
  
  - question: "Why do children with ASD become fixated on certain things, like repeatedly watching the same video?"
    answer: "Fixation on routines can provide a sense of security for children with ASD, and repetitive behaviors may help alleviate anxiety. Parents can sometimes leverage these interests by incorporating them into learning activities while gradually guiding the child to adapt to changes."
  
  - question: "Can children with ASD learn to be self-reliant—for example, feeding, dressing, or bathing themselves?"
    answer: "Yes, but it requires a step-by-step approach and a lot of patience. Parents can break tasks down into manageable steps (for instance, first learning to turn on the tap, then using a towel) and use visual cues like pictures or flowcharts to help the child gradually develop independence."
